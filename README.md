Hi! I'm Dennis Corabi and I am a computer science student at Bicocca university in Milan.
I am also working for a company based in Lecco, Italy, called **MAS Consulting**, as a junior full-stack software developer.

## Next steps
- Get Bachelor's degree in CS
- Get IELTS certification
- Start contributing in open source projects 
- Bulk up (I'm kind of skinny) -> from 72kg to 80kg

That's all I had to say about _moi_. Have a nice day :)
